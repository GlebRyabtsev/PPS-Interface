# Programmable Power Supply GUI

This is the control interface for the [programmable lab power supply board](https://github.com/GlebRyabtsev/PPS-Board) I designed. The program communicates with the board microcontroller using request-response model and supports setting target voltage individually for every channel, as well as display real output voltage and current. In addition, a guided calibration script is provided.
